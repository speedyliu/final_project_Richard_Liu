Final Project 
# Introduction

## What: 

In a hypothetical scenario, I want to find out how many \$1M products I need to initiate in order to have 95% confidence that at least one of them will reach \$20M size.  Assuming the probability of every \$1M incremental sales is at XX%.  All sales increases for each product are independent from each other.  Success is defined as sales increase by \$1M for each target size.  Failure is defined as sales does not exceed more than \$1M.

## Why:  

This hypothetical scenario would help project planning through statistical means without having to predict which specific product(s) will be the next to reach $20M sales milestone.  In reality, we can't predict the long term sales outcome of any given product anyway due to their high variance and low population (n=1).
